(** Pattern-matchable identifier of the request for routing purposes.
    Consists of:

    - HTTP method e.g. [`GET], [`POST]
    - [path] i.e. a list of path segments

    E.g., [GET /api/user/1] would be represented as
    [(`GET, ["api", "user", "1"])] *)

type ('ctx, 'resp) t = route -> ('ctx, 'resp) Service.t
(** A server is a function that takes a [route] and returns a service. A
    route is pattern-matchable (see above), so you will almost always do
    that to handle different endpoints with different services. *)

  ?index:'ctx Service.all ->

  route ->
  'ctx Service.all
(** [resource(?index, ?create, ?new_, ?edit, ?show, ?update, ?destroy)]
    returns a resource--that is a server--with the standard HTTP CRUD
    actions that you specify as services. The resource handles the paths
    and sets a reasonable cache policy corresponding to those CRUD
    actions:

    - [GET /scope] or [GET /scope/] calls [index]
    - [POST /scope] calls [create] and disables caching
    - [GET /scope/new] or [GET /scope/new/] calls [new_] and sets the
      response to cache publicly for a week
    - [GET /scope/id/edit] or [GET /scope/id/edit/] calls [edit id]
    - [GET /scope/id] or [GET /scope/id/] calls [show id]
    - [PATCH /scope/id] calls [update `PATCH id] and disables caching
    - [PUT /scope/id] calls [update `PUT id] and disables caching
    - [DELETE /scope/id] calls [destroy id] and disables caching

    The [scope] above is whatever scope you put the resource inside in a
    parent router, or maybe even the toplevel scope [/] if you use the
    resource directly as your toplevel server.

    All the service parameters are optional, with a 404 Not Found
    response as the default. Note that [resource] is just a convenience
    function; you can implement a custom resource yourself if needed, by
    creating a server function of type [('ctx, 'resp) t] instead. *)

val serve :
  ?port:int ->
  (unit, [Response.http | Response.websocket]) t ->
  unit
(** [serve(?port, server)] starts the top-level [server] listening on
    [port]. Top-level servers must have no context i.e. their context is
    [()]. *)
